# scripts

## Motivation 

 **“φʕ•ᴥ•oʔ**
 
 I write a lot of small, one-off scripts for lots of reasons. I have not been actively maintaining any repository for safe-keeping of my scripts since in many cases I can reuse them; they also may be of use to others. Below is a general outline of the general categories which I have used to classify my scripts. This should match my directory tree. In many cases I do not take the time to properly document my scripts as in many cases they are trivial. Yet, for some which get complex, I may include separate `README` files or offer other documentation. Most scripts will have vital details in the script in the form of inline comments.
